# String Vaidation

This program analyzes a string to verify if it contains certain kinds
of characters. 

The user inputs a string, e.g., 

```
"asDf43l"
```
and this program examines whether the input string contains:
alphanumeric, alphabetic, digits, lower case letters, and/or upper 
case letters, respectively.

This project is useful because it provides a good example of the
handy function called 'getattr()'. I implement this function
so that I can pass attributes as arguments in the functin that 
I wrote.
